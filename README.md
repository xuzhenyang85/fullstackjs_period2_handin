Use Express with a sufficient engine to create server side generated pages (similar to JSP on 2. semester)
Use Express middleware to interact with the request and response objects (similar to Servlet/JAX-rs filters)
Use Express with sessions (after period two, using a separate database as session store) (similar to Servlet sessions)
Test backend server code with Mocha and Chai (similar to jUnit, and REST Assured on 3. semester)
Implement a REST API with node and Express (Similar to JAX-rs on 3. semester)
Implement basic security features for a node/Express server (which we actually never really covered before)
Deploy a Node server using a process manager (similar to what we did on 3. semester)
So when you are done with this period, you can do everything (more), web-related, in JavaScript that you learned with Java on 2. and 3. semester ;-)
